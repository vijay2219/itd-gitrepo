##Ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
##A defaultBackend is often configured in an Ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec
##normally it is somewhat like other services but other services can only load balance the request but cannot route them, this ingress will do that
